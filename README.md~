VimParser is used an addon for Vim built in python and VimScript, that uses Machine Learning to generate alternate ways to preform common tasks based on your previous commands.

Installtion instructions will be coming soon (sometime mid october). Please understand that we are still in a development state, so please bare with us and report any bugs :)


VimParser is modular and it's components can be used as stand alone
